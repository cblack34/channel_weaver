# Channel Weaver Configuration File
# ===================================
#
# This file defines how input audio channels are processed and combined.
#
# CHANNELS SECTION
# ----------------
# Each channel entry defines processing for an input channel:
#
#   ch:        (required) Input channel number (1-32, 1-based indexing)
#   name:      (required) Display name for the channel (used in output filenames)
#   action:    (optional) Processing action - one of:
#              - PROCESS: Extract and output as individual mono file (default)
#              - SKIP: Ignore this channel entirely
#              - BUS: Reserve for stereo bus mixing (don't output individually)
#   output_ch: (optional) Override output channel number in filename
#              Defaults to the input channel number (ch)
#
# Any channels not listed here will be auto-created with action=PROCESS
# and name="Channel N" where N is the channel number.
#
# BUSES SECTION
# -------------
# Each bus entry combines multiple channels into a stereo output:
#
#   file_name: (required) Output filename (without .wav extension)
#   type:      (optional) Bus type - currently only STEREO supported
#   slots:     (required) Mapping of slot positions to input channels:
#              - LEFT: Channel number for left audio
#              - RIGHT: Channel number for right audio
#
# Channels assigned to buses should have action=BUS to avoid duplicate output.
#
# Example with all options:
#
#   channels:
#     - ch: 1
#       name: Kick
#       action: PROCESS
#     - ch: 7
#       name: Overhead L
#       action: BUS
#
#   buses:
#     - file_name: 07_Overheads
#       type: STEREO
#       slots:
#         LEFT: 7
#         RIGHT: 8
